## Issue Checklist <!-- 我确认我已经查看了 -->
<!-- Change [ ] to [x] to select, not [ x] or [x ] (将 [ ] 换成 [x] 来选择，而非 [ x] 或者 [x ]) -->

- [ ] I am using [the latest](https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next/releases/latest) version of NexT.
- [ ] I have executed `hexo clean`, cleared the browser cache and disabled all CDN services (e.g. Cloudflare Rocket Loader), this issue still exists.
- [ ] I have confirmed that this issue only appears in theme NexT, but cannot be reproduced in other themes (e.g. default theme landscape). In other words, prove that this is a NexT issue, not a issue from Hexo.
- [ ] I have already viewed [NexT Documentation Site](http://theme-next.org/docs/) and [Hexo Docs page](https://hexo.io/docs/), especially [Troubleshooting](https://hexo.io/docs/troubleshooting.html) part.
- [ ] I have already viewed the latest Roadmap on GitHub and searched for current [issues](https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue), which does not help me.
